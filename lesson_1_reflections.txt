What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pros of manually creating commit: You can save when you have made significant
changes and differences between two versions. 
Cons of manually creating commit: Sometimes you will not commit for a long time
because you can be wreckless or you don't remember
Pros of automatic save: Creates a lot of saves that you may not have made which
can be helpful. If you are forgetful withs avig this can help
Cons of automatic save: Can create too many versions that arent useful

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Git allows for saving multiple files in one commit because the files are interrelated which each other
whereas the files in a google doc are less interrelated. This means that changing something in one file will have an effect
on another file too thus it is important to keep track of all files that are associated wtih each other to notice how one change in one file
may affect other files. If you dould only save each file seperately then there will be many versions of each file that don't line up in teh same
commit time frame as the others wthis overcomplicates analyzing differences between versions of files.

Use git clone URL
then cd to the folder with the repository
then git log
then lookat the commit ID
then git diff between commit ID of interest
note the differences usign the color labelled text

IF you have our previous versions commited then you can experiement and add potentailly app breaking code because you have a previous owrking version. So even if your new experimetal version crashes you can go back to your working version without worrying about jepordizing your entire project while experimetning.
