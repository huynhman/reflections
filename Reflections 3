When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
You can share your work with others. You can collaborate better. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If you want to experiment or try something new on the files in the remote, but don't want it to affect your local files then it's better that
pull is done manually to preserve your local files in a version that is working seperately from Github.
