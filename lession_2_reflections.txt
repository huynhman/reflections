What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates a .git file in the folder. This .git folder is data for the repository
in other words the .git folder contains hsitory data of all of your files (commits)
in the folder. THis is essential in keeping track of the different versions
of your files over time. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is between the workign directory and repository. Working directory is located on your hard drive
and the repository is the data history of the filessssss. Staging area may be useful beacuse
it ensures the suer knows exactly what he coomits to the repositroy before doign so.
